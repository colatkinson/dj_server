# DJ Server

DJ Server is a simple application that allows a single computer to play audio, while many people/devices can control the playback. The server provides a simple web interface, to which users can add tracks and playlists from SoundCloud. These are then played back consecutively.

## Motivation

We've all been there. You're tryna hold down a solid yanger, and you've got all the necessary supplies. The cheese, crackers, and non-alcoholic beer are all laid out in an ornate spread. But suddenly you realize you're missing a key element to any good function: the sick beats.

You panic. You could use your computer, but then you have to leave it perilously perched on top of your speakers. Or you could use your phone, but then where will you put homegirl's number? On a piece of paper? *Dique*.

But lo, there is a solution: DJ Server X-Treme Edition. You grab a shitty old netbook and follow the easy installation process (detailed below). When the homies start rollin' in, you just grab your phone, paste in a link to your illest playlist, and you're good. And when your boy rolls up with a request, you just do the same thing. You don't even have to stop hollain'.

So whether it's a kickback or a schlanger, if it doesn't have DJ Server Home Premium, it's finna be whack.
